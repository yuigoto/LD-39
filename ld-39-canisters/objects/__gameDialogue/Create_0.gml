This is a test of endurance, where you'll be using our all-new morphing training ground! All you have to do is pass through 100 stages, shooting all the robots and then you're ready to go for...er...wait...tech department calling....";

It's all cool, it works the same and has the same power...er...except that the plasma tank is leaking a little bit and using both tools might drain your tank a bit faster..."
