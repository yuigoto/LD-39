YX : Jam : LD39 - PLASMAGUN!
============================

_LD39 Theme: **Running Out Of Power**_

> A top-down, twin-stick shooter about wasting ammo.

Hello, Soldier! Welcome to our 100 room training program! :100:

You're here to gain proficiency in using our latest model of weaponry and dashing gadgets, all powered by the magnificent plasma! What's _plasma_? Well, you don't need to know, leave it for the scientists! :wink:

For this training, all you have to do is use our specially-made morphing training grounds and pass through 100 rooms, hitting our training bots and making use of our special equipment! Easy, right? That's what we think so! Because...wait...telephone ringing...technical staff...just a moment...

...

Oh...well, looks like we ran out of equipment! BUT we do have a prototype pack you can **JUST USE**, save for the fact that the plasma tank might be leaking a little bit so you'll have to rugh, but I don't think it's a problem, right? Nice! :smile:

And to you, there, looking at us right now. Yeah, **YOU** on the chair! To help us test this stuff here you'll have to use your mouse + keyboard or an X360 controller (no endorsements here).

That's it! We're counting on you! Our bots won't hurt you (too much), but don't die in there!
